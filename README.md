Pronic number is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, n=x*(x+1). 

Write a program which, for a given input n, detect if the number is pronic or not. 

Some Examples: 

6: True 

42: True 

132: True 

2550: True 

10100: True 

4: False 

66: False 

133: False 

1666: False 

17289: False
